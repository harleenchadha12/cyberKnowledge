        <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" class="image" src="./Images/Phishing.jpeg">
        <p class="lead">Scammers use email or text messages to trick you into giving them your personal and financial information. But there are several ways to protect yourself.
Scammers use email or text messages to try to steal your passwords, account numbers, or Social Security numbers. If they get that information, they could get access to your email, bank, or other accounts. Or they could sell your information to other scammers. Scammers launch thousands of phishing attacks like these every day — and they’re often successful.
Scammers often update their tactics to keep up with the latest news or trends, but here are some common tactics used in phishing emails or text messages:
Phishing emails and text messages often tell a story to trick you into clicking on a link or opening an attachment. You might get an unexpected email or text message that looks like it’s from a company you know or trust, like a bank or a credit card or utility company. Or maybe it’s from an online payment website or app. The message could be from a scammer, who might

        <h2 class="display-4">Four Ways To Protect Yourself From Phishing</h2>
        <p class="lead">
            <ol class="lead">
                <li>Protect your computer by using security software. Set the software to update automatically so it will deal with any new security threats.</li>
                <li>Protect your cell phone by setting software to update automatically. These updates could give you critical protection against security threats.</li>
                <li>Protect your accounts by using multi-factor authentication. Some accounts offer extra security by requiring two or more credentials to log in to your account. This is called multi-factor authentication. The extra credentials you need to log in to your account fall into three categories:
                    •	something you know — like a passcode, a PIN, or the answer to a security question.
                    •	something you have — like a one-time verification passcode you get by text, email, or from an authenticator app; or a security key
                    •	something you are — like a scan of your fingerprint, your retina, or your face
                    </li>
                <li>Protect your data by backing it up. Back up the data on your computer to an external hard drive or in the cloud. Back up the data on your phone, too</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
       
        <h2 class="display-4">What To Do if You Suspect a Phishing Attack</h2>
        <p class="lead">If you get an email or a text message that asks you to click on a link or open an attachment, answer this question: 
            Do I have an account with the company or know the person who contacted me?
            If the answer is “No,” it could be a phishing scam. Go back and review the advice in How to recognize phishing and look for signs of a phishing scam. If you see them, report the message and then delete it.
            If the answer is “Yes,” contact the company using a phone number or website you know is real — not the information in the email. Attachments and links might install harmful malware.
            </p>
            <h2 class="display-4">What To Do if You Responded to a Phishing Email</h2>
        <p class="lead">If you think a scammer has your information, like your Social Security, credit card, or bank account number, go to IdentityTheft.gov. There you’ll see the specific steps to take based on the information that you lost.
            If you think you clicked on a link or opened an attachment that downloaded harmful software, update your computer’s security software. Then run a scan and remove anything it identifies as a problem.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="display-4">How To Report Phishing</h2>
        <p class="lead">If you got a phishing email or text message, report it. The information you give helps fight scammers.
           <li class="lead" >If you got a phishing email, forward it to the Anti-Phishing Working Group at reportphishing@apwg.org.</li>
           <li class="lead">If you got a phishing text message, forward it to SPAM (7726).</li>
            <li class="lead">Report the phishing attempt to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.</li>
